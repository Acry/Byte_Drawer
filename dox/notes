Bit - Binary Digit

First of all, if I use a char, which has per definition the magnitude of 1 byte to represent
a number and if the number is 0 or 1 the bit represents not a digit, it represents a number.

Hardware/device
the physical cell - distinct cell with a fix address.
the logical cell - we dont care about the address of the physical cell.

the cell or field can have two states, it is switchable
set or unset

morse code has 3 states, long, short, pause/nothing/void

representation - Software-engineer
interpretation - user

If I use a char to set traffic lights, numbers or digits have no meaning at all.

I am respresenting states by colors and I want to achieve an effect and I have a reason/cause.

The reason is avoiding negative effects on a flow.

I control, program, regulate the flow.

Decision making
Even my traffic lights may have no meaning to a person.
Colors are just colors, if you look at an Aurora.
If the receiver of my message is a machine it must be able to "read"/decipher my RGB-Code.

The message or tiding of Red is halt, Green is go, and Yellow/Orange are attention.
But I will represent BLUE as Attention.

Probably red/dark orange is like a hot flame or glowing iron.
Nowadays it is known that the most heat in a flame is the blue part, oxygene.

The 3 colors have no special meaning to a baby, they have just radiance.
We need to learn that we better stop at a red traffic light.

Psychology of colors
Ocean blue/greenish, pink noise - lost, absent

An integer has different magnitudes.
A datatype, even a native one, those that are defined
