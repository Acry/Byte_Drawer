Byte Drawer

Flipping Bits on a real char and visualize that.

![Screenshot](./screenshot)

This is WORK IN PROGRESS.

The code is nearly at a fork state.
But currently only works for little Endian.  

* fork 1 is an educational program to learn about Bit-order aka endianess.

* fork 2 is a pixel drawer to make monochromatic assets for classic VCS.

* fork 3 could be a fully fledged Pixel/Icon Editor.

Left MB for flipping Bits.  
key w = write Byte  
key r = read Byte
